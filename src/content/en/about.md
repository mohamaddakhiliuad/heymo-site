# About Me

Hi, I’m **Mohammad Dakhilitarghi** — a digital strategist, web developer, and marketing consultant.

Over the past 15+ years, I’ve worked across **software development, digital marketing, and business consulting**. My focus has always been on helping people and businesses simplify growth in a world that often feels complex and overwhelming.  

I’m not the loudest voice in the room, but I believe in **clarity, empathy, and consistency**. My approach is simple: listen carefully, understand real needs, and then build solutions that actually work.  

### What I do
- **Smart websites & Shopify solutions** — clean, modern, and growth-focused.  
- **Headless & custom web systems** — from React/Next.js to databases and APIs.  
- **SEO & digital marketing strategies** — actionable, data-driven, and long-term.  
- **NFC smart business cards** — bridging offline and online presence with a tap.  

### What I believe
Technology should **serve people**, not overwhelm them. Every project I take on is about **making things easier**, **building trust**, and **leaving room for growth**.

If my work can help a business stand a little stronger, or make life a little simpler for someone, then I consider that a success.

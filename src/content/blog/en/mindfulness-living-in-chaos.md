## Introduction

We live in the full storm of chaos and intrusive thoughts.  
We fear accepting that pain and suffering are inseparable parts of life.  
We run away from them, worried they will exhaust us.  
But trying to cover pain only makes it fester.

## Three Steps to Live Amid Chaos

1️⃣ **Acknowledgment**  
☀️ Suffering is an inseparable part of life.  
🌺 I, too, suffer — just like everyone else.

2️⃣ **Courage**  
The courage to face and consciously listen to our suffering is what empowers us.

3️⃣ **Mindful Presence**  
☘️ Presence is healing. It gives us the chance to transform suffering.  

🧘‍♀️ Sit and notice your breath.  
Walk and pay attention to your steps.  
When you drink tea, just drink tea.

## Conclusion

✅ Mindfulness is the way to live in total chaos.  
🟢 Look at your wound with awareness — for that is where the light enters.

## Introduction
Master **Alijan Alijanpour** is one of the prominent figures in contemporary Persian miniature, offering a fresh perspective through his work **United Couple**.  
Executed entirely in black and white using only lines, this piece stands as a unique achievement in the history of Persian miniature.  
Its message transcends technique: a narrative of love, unity, and connection, born from the heart of Iranian mysticism and expressed in the universal language of art.

## The Idea Behind the Work
The concept had been in my mind for more than eighteen years. I was always thinking about how I could present miniature linework in a new, distinctive way.  
Traditional miniature is full of lines — fine, thick, intricate. I wanted to see if it was possible to convey the deepest emotion with the fewest possible lines.

One day, a friend said to me:  
> "Master, create something new, something fresh for the whole world."

He showed me a colorful image of a man and woman embracing. It was rich in color, their forms merged into one.  
I thought: if I wanted to simplify this scene, I would have to start with the line.  
He later suggested:  
> "Begin with the kiss."  
It felt like he had handed me the key.

## From Kiss to Harmony
I began studying depictions of kisses in films, paintings, and photographs — transforming them into pure line.  
After several sketches, I found the form I was searching for.

*Kissing – a symbol of love and unity.*

One of the first pieces was a mother holding and kissing her child — an image that has always stayed with me.  
Soon, the concept of **day and night** emerged:  
- One version in white lines on a dark background.  
- Another in black lines on a light background.  

Gradually, the work evolved:  
**Kissing → Dancing → Flying → Harmony** — the moment where two souls unite completely.

## Reception and Global Introduction
One early collector purchased reproduction rights for ten works.  
Later, at my friend Eddie’s gallery, I met Suzanne from Montreal. She was deeply moved by the collection, acquired two more pieces, and quickly introduced the works on various art platforms.  

Suzanne told me:  
> "With these simple lines, you are revealing spirituality."

## Personal and Symbolic Responses
A well-known French television host wrote to me:  
> "May I have your ‘Dancing’ design tattooed on my body? This piece has moved my soul so deeply."

Similar requests came from **South Africa** and the **United States**.  
In Montreal, a newlywed couple asked to have one of my Couples tattooed — the wife on her calf, the husband on his forearm — as a symbol of their union.

## Philosophy of the Work
To me, **United Couple** is a form of sacred art — pure, free of superficial figures, revealing humanity and character through simplicity.  

> "The absence of a united couple is equal to the destruction of the world."

---

## The Woman as the Source
In parts of the work, the woman appears alone — for example, a woman with a horse, without the man.  
In art history, horses are almost always depicted with men.  
Here, I wanted to show that **guidance and strength originate from the woman**, flowing to the man.  
Every movement in this series begins with her.

In another part, a woman dances alone — powerful and self-contained, yet in perfect harmony with the order of the universe, like a blooming tulip.  
For me, **woman is the symbol of creation and the guardian of the earth**. Without femininity, existence cannot survive.

---

## Message and Timelessness
Art is alive only when it is divine.  
Without love and inner spirit, it is like food without salt or spice — tasteless and ineffective.

Once, a viewer asked:  
> "What is this painting about?"

I said:  
> It is the story of two lovers standing by a wall, sharing a kiss and the warmth of their hearts.  
They are gone, but the echo of that moment remains — resting on the wall, breathing — even after years have passed.

---

## History and Context
Though the idea had been with me for eighteen years, work on the series began in **2011** and continued for four years.  
Unlike the ornate, colorful tradition of Persian art, **United Couple** is minimalist, monochrome, and created entirely with line — nothing else. Yet it carries meaning, form, and energy.

## Connection to Iranian Mysticism and the Resurrection Project
Iranian mysticism is filled with ethics, knowledge, and profound wisdom — the kind that inspired poets like **Attar**, who wrote:  
> "The earth, beneath the nine domes of heaven, is but a poppy seed upon the sea…"

This vision led me to my **Resurrection Project** — a three-dimensional artistic journey with three central scenes:  
1. **United Couple** – symbolizing eternal love and union.  
2. **Mothers and Their Children** – the source of life and affection.  
3. **Mystics** – moving from the depths of spirituality toward salvation.

## Closing Words
This conversation reflects only a part of **Master Alijanpour’s** ocean of experience.  
For him, art is not merely a matter of technique — it is a language for expressing **love, spirituality, and the eternal bond between human beings**.

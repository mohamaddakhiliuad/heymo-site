          <p>
            Master Alijanpour founded Irena Art Gallery & School in Toronto in 2000, where he has taught
            hundreds of students for over two decades. His teaching philosophy combines classical Persian
            techniques with spiritual and poetic reflection, nurturing not only technical skill but artistic soul.

          <p className="mt-2">
            Through workshops, mentorship, and public lectures, he has helped transmit the delicate art
            of miniature painting to a new generation in Canada and beyond.

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Artistic Influence</h3>
          <p>
            As a contemporary master, Alijanpour has redefined Persian miniature by infusing it with cosmic
            abstraction and the divine feminine. His works reflect an inner mystical journey inspired by poets
            such as Rumi, Hafez, and Shams.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            By blending classical tradition with symbolic modern expression, he has influenced a wave of artists
            in Iran, Canada, and the Middle East who seek to bridge heritage with higher consciousness.

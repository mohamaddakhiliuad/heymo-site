    'Throughout my career, I have journeyed with intention to push beyond the traditions of Persian Miniature to expand upon it — shifting its emphasis from the physical world unto that of the spiritual world.',
  bio: [
    "Born in 1956 in Fereydunkenar, Iran, Master Alijanpour discovered his passion for art at the age of seven. He immersed himself in traditional Persian miniature, gradually developing a distinctive style that merges classical techniques with modern spirituality.",
    "After immigrating to Canada in 2000, he founded Irena Art Gallery & School in Toronto, where he continues to teach, exhibit, and evolve his craft. His artistic philosophy is deeply influenced by Persian poets such as Rumi, Hafez, and Shams, with many of his works embodying themes of divine femininity, cosmic symbolism, and inner transformation.",
    "Alijanpour's paintings have been displayed in prestigious museums including the Royal Ontario Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art Tehran, the National Museum of China, and the Iranian Handicrafts Museum. His legacy bridges East and West, ancient and modern, seen and unseen."
